# 2. Hash Tables

## Why Hash Tables are so important.

- HashTables improve time, more in nested loops
- Hash Tables are usually the answer to improve Time Complexity
- Hash Tables and precomputed information (i.e. sorted) are some of the best ways to optimized the code.
- Look at the Time vs Space tradeoff. Sometimes storing extra state in memory can help the time. (Runtime)
- Space time tradeoffs: Hashtables usually solve this a lot of times. You use more space, but you can get a time optimization to the process.
