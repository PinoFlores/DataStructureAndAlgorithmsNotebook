## Binary Tree

Perfect Binary Tree

Full Bunary Tree

1 or 0 child node

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

It's called **ordered** or **sorted binary tree** is a binary tree in which each vertex has only up 2 children
that satisfies **BTS property**: _All vertices in the left subtree of a vertex must hold a value smaller than its_
_own and all vertices in the right subtree of a vertex must hold a value larger than its own_

| Algorithm  | Average      | Worst case     |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
|            | **Balanced** | **Unbalanced** |
| **Space**  | O(_n_)       | O(_n_)         |
| **Search** | O(log _n_)   | O(_n_)         |
| **Insert** | O(log _n_)   | O(_n_)         |
| **Delete** | O(log _n_)   | O(_n_)         |

**Unbalanced BTS** is like to have a **LinkedList** the run time
increase to O(_n_).
